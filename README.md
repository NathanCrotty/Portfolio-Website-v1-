# Portfolio-Website-v1-

I'm making this website as a digittal version of my resume so I can not only talk about my skills but also show them.

This is an updated version of my thesis project for FreeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Developement" course.
Over time I'll ad projects I've done. Pretty soon this whole thing will probably be overhauled and I'll redo it using Django or React.
