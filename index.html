        <h3>Let's Work together!</h3>
        <p>I was nine when I started programming, entranced with my ability to create.
          I was homeshooled then and spent most of my time on <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/profile/Nathan22222">Khan Academy</a>.
          In sixth grade I started public school and was frustrated with the learning pace.
          "Why do we need to spend weeks on a concept if it takes an hour to learn?" I'd ask. 
          I taught myself python and programmed bots that would do the calculations for me.
          I tried to show my classmates, but they unimpressed, saying they preffered photomath.</p>
          <p>In high school I was excited to see that they had a programming class.
            I would always finish my assignments early, so I could help other people on theirs. I would also add extra features to mine. For example,
            when I got an assignment where I was intructed to create a madlib I created a program which could turn anything into a madlib.
            I decided that it was too boring if people knew what the input text was beforehand, so I made it so the user was given a
            <a href='https://codehs.com/sandbox/nathancrotty/mad-lib'>random wikipedia article as a madlib.</a></p>
          <p>Recently, I graduated High School early so I could spend more time programming. Now I'm programming everyday and I want to turn it into a career.
            I know Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. <a href="#contact">Contact me</a> If you'd like to work with me.</p>
